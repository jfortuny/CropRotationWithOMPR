# Synopsis

The Crop Rotation model attempts to allocate crops to fields such that the consumption needs of the
user are satisfied while adhering to a set of constraints, described below.


## Elements of the model

There are some basic components of the model that are required for the model to exist. These are:

* A Farm, which is a collection of Fields
* Fields in the farm. The fields can be used in the determination of the rotation or can be set aside. The fields have 
a _measure_, which is under user control and there is an amount of that _measure_ in each field. In a vegetable crop
setting, the measure will likely be _length_ of row (feet or meters of beds or rows, depending on setup); in a farm crop setting, the measure will likely be _surface_ of each field (acres or hectares in each field).


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
